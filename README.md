Style-imitative Text Generation using LSTM-RNNs

## Introduction
We develop a system using long short-term memory recurrent neural networks to
generate style-imitative text based on Sherlock Holmes novels. We investigate the per-
formance of this system against that of Markov models, and vary hyperparameters
(specifically, node and hidden layer numbers as well as training epochs) for LSTM-
RNNs to gauge the effectiveness of particular system configurations in generating text,
and evaluate results using a modification to the BLEU metric.
